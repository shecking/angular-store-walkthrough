<!--
Anything starting with `*ng` is code for creating a structural device in Angular. These devices add, remove, and change the elements they are attached to. `*ng` values will always be contained in quotes, with semicolons separating any attributes.
-->
<!--
In this case, *ngIf is used to display a name, price, and description IF a product exists and has these attributes.
-->
<!--
Event binding is handled using ( ). In this file, the Buy button has a (click) binding, activating the addToCart(product) method.
-->
<div *ngIf="product">
  <h3>{{ product.name }}</h3>
  <h4>{{ product.price | currency }}</h4>
  <p>{{ product.description }}</p>
  <!-- When users click on a product name, they are directed to a page URL that includes the product id, and displays the above information for that product. This information is swapped out depending on what value `product` has. -->

  <button (click)="addToCart(product)">Buy</button>
</div>
